        <h2>Exercise Guide</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our Exercise Guide! This guide provides information on different types of exercises and recommendations for various health conditions.</p>

        <h3>Types of Exercises:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aerobic Exercise:</strong> Also known as cardio, these exercises increase your heart rate and improve cardiovascular health. Examples include walking, jogging, swimming, and cycling.</li>
            <li><strong>Strength Training:</strong> These exercises focus on building muscle strength and endurance. Examples include weightlifting, resistance band exercises, and bodyweight exercises like push-ups and squats.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility Exercises:</strong> These exercises improve flexibility and range of motion in your joints. Examples include yoga, stretching, and tai chi.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance Exercises:</strong> These exercises improve balance and stability, reducing the risk of falls, especially in older adults. Examples include standing on one leg, heel-to-toe walk, and balance exercises on a stability ball.</li>
            <li><strong>Functional Training:</strong> These exercises mimic everyday movements to improve overall functional fitness. Examples include squats, lunges, and core exercises like planks and bridges.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Exercise Recommendations:</h3>
        <p>It's important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any exercise program, especially if you have a pre-existing health condition. Here are some general recommendations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heart Disease:</strong> Avoid strenuous exercises and opt for moderate-intensity aerobic activities like walking or swimming. Monitor your heart rate and stop exercising if you experience chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath.</li>
            <li><strong>Arthritis:</strong> Low-impact exercises like swimming, cycling, and yoga are beneficial for joint health. Avoid high-impact activities that may exacerbate joint pain.</li>
            <li><strong>Diabetes:</strong> Both aerobic and strength training exercises are important for managing diabetes. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with two or more days of strength training exercises.</li>
            <li><strong>General Population:</strong> Incorporate a mix of aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance exercises into your routine for overall fitness. Start slowly and gradually increase intensity and duration as your fitness improves.</li>
        </ul>
