        <h2>Stress Management Guide</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our Stress Management Guide! This guide provides strategies and techniques to help you manage stress effectively and improve your overall well-being.</p>

        <h3>Effective Stress Management Techniques:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Deep Breathing Exercises:</strong> Practice deep breathing to calm your mind and reduce stress. Take slow, deep breaths, focusing on your breath as it enters and leaves your body.</li>
            <li><strong>Mindfulness Meditation:</strong> Incorporate mindfulness meditation into your daily routine to cultivate awareness and promote relaxation. Focus on the present moment, letting go of worries about the past or future.</li>
            <li><strong>Progressive Muscle Relaxation:</strong> Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body to release tension and induce relaxation. Start with your toes and work your way up to your head.</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise Regularly:</strong> Physical activity helps reduce stress and improve mood by releasing endorphins, the body's natural stress relievers. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthy Lifestyle Choices:</strong> Maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and avoiding excessive alcohol and caffeine consumption. These lifestyle factors can impact your stress levels and overall well-being.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Support:</strong> Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for emotional support and encouragement during times of stress. Connecting with others can provide perspective and help you feel less alone.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Prioritize tasks and break them down into manageable steps to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Use tools like to-do lists, calendars, and schedules to stay organized and on track.</li>
            <li><strong>Seek Professional Help:</strong> If stress becomes overwhelming or chronic, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. Therapy, counseling, or medication may be recommended to manage stress effectively.</li>
